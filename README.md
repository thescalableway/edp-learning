# EDP (Enterprise Data Platform) Learning

This repository is designed for learning data engineering best practices using the following technologies:

- dlt
- Prefect
- Python

Lessons are developed on an as-needed basis, with several already available for you to explore. Check out the tutorials section to get started!

Each lesson is self-contained and leverages public data sources, so you donâ€™t need any specific data platform infrastructure. In fact, you can follow along directly from GitHub using Codespaces for a seamless learning experience.

## Getting Started with Codespaces

To get started, click on `Code > Open with Codespaces` and GitHub will create an environment automatically.
